# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.
- # Current Constraints
- Time wise for this project is small typically with what students are usually provided. This is a full summer term class meaning that it covers the UNCC summer term 1 and summer term 2. While there is a good amount of time given to students there is not the same as compared to the fall and spring semesters. 
- Meeting our requirements. With the provided time there may be some small bugs or errors that may be unseen by our professional team. In these instances where proper testing has taken place and these issues still persist, our requirements for ourselves will have not been met. 
- Resource Limitations: The project must adhere to specific hardware and software resource limitations like we only have access to VS code and github to make this project. These limitations can impact the scalability and performance of the software system and require careful optimization and resource management.
- Team Size: The project team has a fixed number of members, and additional resources may not be available. This constraint can impact the scope and complexity of the project, as the team's capacity to handle tasks and deliverables is limited by the available manpower. Effective task allocation and collaboration are crucial to meet project deadlines successfully.
-  Constraint: Technology Stack Limitation
Description: The project must be developed using the Flask and Python technology stack, limiting the choice of backend technologies.
Priority: Medium
Rationale: The constraint ensures consistency and compatibility across the project components, but it may limit certain advanced features that could be achieved with other technologies.
Testing: Regular code reviews and compatibility checks will be performed to ensure that the chosen technology stack aligns with the project's requirements and allows for efficient development.

-  Constraint: Platform Compatibility
Description: The software system must be compatible with major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) and support different screen resolutions, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices.

- Payment Processing Solution: The online store must integrate with a specific payment gateway provider that complies with the necessary security standards (e.g., PCI DSS). This constraint ensures that the chosen payment gateway meets the required security and regulatory standards for handling customer payment information securely.
- Integration Timeline: The integration with the payment gateway must be completed within a specific timeline to meet the project's launch schedule. This constraint ensures that the project stays on track and enables the online store to start accepting payments promptly after deployment.



## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- # UC-1:
	- **Description**: When user information is entered through the interface the information provided will be sent towards a database that will update accordingly. 
	- **Actors**: What we see here in this case are the user, code, database. Here the user is the one providing the system with information such as their name, username, password, date of birth. The code will take this information and ensure that it is currently formatted within the database, meaning if date of birth is entered as a string the database may need the information to be entered as varchar. The database being the final actor will be actively updated with correct user information. The database will ensure that no two users are the same, correct data will only be processed (if the user enters incorrect information there will be exception errors to combat this). All three actors will ensure that the user information is stored correctly, easy to access for the correct personnel, and that retrieving data for users or software engineers is easy. 
	- **Preconditions**: In order to have data stored correctly the user must first be able to complete a verification process. In this case we are providing the user with a randomized six letter code in which the user will need to enter the exact number back into the system. The user must also be able to complete all necessary prompts to ensure there are no null entries within the system. 
	- **Postconditions**: Once data is stored the user can freely come back to the store without the need to create a new account. The account information of the user will be stored in order to maintain a professional and optimal experience.

- # UC-2: 
	- **Description**: Forgot my password entering identical passwords, to ensure the user is not entering the same password as their current password the system will check the database to see what the current password is. When a user forgets their password they have an option to reset said password. They will be prompted where they will type a new password consisting of varchar type in order to take string characters, int characters, and special characters. If they enter a password that is identical to their current one they will receive a message saying “cannot change password to current password”. This saves the user time as now they remember what their current password is as well as saving computational time. The system will use a .get() to trace back only the password within the database as all other user information in this case is irrelevant.
	- **Actors**: Here the actors in this example are the user, code, and database. Here the user enters their password in order to create a new password. Before the process can continue a check will be made to ensure that the user is not using their current password. Here the code we have created will pull the password that the user currently has. The database will be used as a source of information, here since the user is already logged into their account all the code will have to do is pull the password from the database. Once the password is pulled the coded will compare the user input to what is within the system. If the same password is entered an output will be given to the user and the prompt box will be cleared. The message will read “cannot change password to current password”.
	- **Preconditions**: The user is either logged into their account or is able to enter information crucial to their account such as their email or username. 
	- **Postconditions**: If passwords are different the database will be updated with the new user password. If the password is the same the software will not go forward with updating their information instead the password will be erased from the prompt and inform the user that they tried to enter their current password. 

- # UC-3: 
	- **Description**: User Login. The system allows registered users to log in using their username and password. Upon successful login, the user gains access to their personalized dashboard and can start using the system's features and functionalities.
	- **Actors**: Registered users and the system.
	- **Preconditions**: The user must have a registered account with a valid username and password. The user must navigate to the login page of the system.
	- **Postconditions**: Once logged in, the system recognizes the user's identity and grants access to their account-specific data and features until they log out or the session expires.

- # UC-4: 
	- **Description**: Adding Items to Cart. As a user browses through the system's product catalog, they can add items to their shopping cart for future purchase. The system maintains a list of selected items and their quantities in the user's shopping cart until they complete the purchase.
	- **Actors**: Regular users (shoppers) and the system.
	- **Preconditions**: The user must be logged into their account. The product catalog must be accessible and contain items available for purchase.
	- **Postconditions**: The selected items are added to the user's shopping cart, and the system updates the cart's contents. The user can continue shopping, remove items from the cart, or proceed to the checkout process when ready to make the purchase.

 - # UC-5: User Registration
	- **Description**: This use case describes the process of a user creating a new account on the platform.
	-**Actors**: User
	-**Preconditions**:
		1-The user must have access to the internet.
		2-The user must be on the registration page of the application.
	-**Postconditions**:
		3-The user successfully registers a new account.
		4-The user receives a verification email to confirm the account.

	- # UC-6: Job Search
	- **Description**: This use case involves the user searching for software engineering jobs in Charlotte.
	- **Actors**: User
	-**Preconditions**:
		1- The user must have a registered account and be logged in.
		2- The user must be on the job search page of the application.
		3- The user must have specified Charlotte as the location and Software Engineering as the job role.	
	-**Postconditions**:
		4- The system displays a list of relevant job results based on the search criteria.
		5- The user can view detailed information about each job and apply if interested.

- # UC-6: 
	- **Description**: When a customer places an order, the online store will process the payment and update the order status accordingly.
	- **Actors**: Customer, Order Processing System, Payment Gateway, Order Database.
	- **Preconditions**: The customer logs in to their account, selects products to purchase, and proceeds to the checkout page.
	- **Postconditions**: The customer's order is successfully processed, and the order status is updated in the database. The customer receives an order confirmation email with details about the purchase and shipping status. The order is prepared for shipping and will be delivered to the customer according to the selected shipping method.

- # UC-7: 
	- **Description**: When a customer searches for a product, the online store will display relevant search results based on the customer's query.
	- **Actors**: Customer, Search Engine, Product Catalog.
	- **Preconditions**: The customer must access the search functionality and enter a search query.
	- **Postconditions**: After the search query is submitted, the Search Engine will process the query and retrieve relevant products from the Product Catalog. The online store will display the search results, including product names, descriptions, and images, to the customer.



## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- # US-1:
	- **Type of user**: Customer
	- **Description**: Customer wishes to login but forgets their passcode. They wish to change the passcode and use a familiar passcode. The system says the password is already in use. Customer learns their password is their current password and the system does not need to make any unnecessary changes.

- # US-2:
	- **Type of user**: Admin
	- **Description**: Admin wants to check a user's purchase history as requested by higher authority. Admin is able to go back into the database and review a customer's history. The admin is expected to be able to have permission to see the purchase history as well as the customer's information.

## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

- # Term 1: Exception 
	- **Definition**: An exception is when an error in code appears. These exceptions can range in areas such as the system wanting to take a string variable, letters a-z, but instead a number or special character was entered, to more advanced issues such as code being referenced but not existing due to bad directory location or a slight spelling mistake in said directory. Essentially an exception is where there is an error in code. 
  - # Term 2: Multilingual Support
	- **Definition**: Multilingual support refers to the capability of the software system to provide content and user interfaces in multiple languages. This allows users from different linguistic backgrounds to interact with the system in their preferred language, enhancing accessibility and usability.
  - # Term 3: Database
	- **Definition**: MA database is a structured collection of data that is organized and accessible in various ways. It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.
Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.
  - # Term 4: Search Query 
	- **Definition**: A search query refers to a specific set of keywords or terms entered by a user into a search engine or a search bar to find information, products, or services on the internet. When a user enters a search query, the search engine uses its algorithms to analyze the query and return relevant search results based on the content and relevance of web pages or documents available on the internet.
