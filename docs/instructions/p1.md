# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

This project is based on an online store. This project will be a collaborative effort among four UNCC students. We are currently using python 3.10 to create this project using a template repository. Our goal is to make sure our project runs smoothly, easy to use for users, all requirements are met, as well as provide proper documentation and security for our users. 

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:


- # REQ-1
  - **Description:** The users shall be able to use the provided software in an effective manner without the need of troubleshooting. 
  - **Type:** Non-Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** The requirement is a need in order to ensure users a proper and functional experience. 
  - **Testing:** The final project state will be run multiple times in order to ensure that data is moving currently within the system. Exception errors will be in place to ensure that crashing will not occur. Through thorough testing the final project will be able to work correctly as well as provide means of exceptions. 


- # REQ-2
  - **Description:** Authentication of user whenever they log in to their user account.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** This requirement is important to ensure a user can save their stored information in a secure profile.
  - **Testing:** The final project will be tested multiple times by each group member in unique ways to ensure that logging in and logging out of user sessions work correctly and smoothly with no system crashes. 

- # REQ-3
  - **Description:**  A verification email or message shall be sent to users when an account is created or suspicious activity takes place. 
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** In order to ensure that users feel secure and that their accounts have proper security, this requirement will be implemented. 
  - **Testing:** Multiple different accounts will be made in order to ensure that email verification is being sent out properly and in a timely manner. 

- # REQ-4
- **Description:** The system shall provide a search functionality that allows users to easily find and retrieve specific information from the database.
- **Type:**  Functional
- **Priority:** 2
- **Rationale:** The search functionality is essential for users to efficiently access the information they need, improving overall user experience and productivity.
- **Testing:**  A variety of test cases will be conducted to verify the search feature's accuracy, speed, and handling of different types of search queries.

- # REQ-5
- **Description:** The software should support multiple languages to cater to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
- **Type:** Non-Functional
- **Priority:** 2
- **Rationale:**  By offering multilingual support, the project can reach a broader user base, enhancing its accessibility and usability across various regions and cultures.
- **Testing:** The software will be tested with different language settings to ensure that all user interfaces, messages, and content are correctly displayed in the selected language.

- # REQ-6
- **Description:** The system shall regularly perform data backups and provide a restore functionality to prevent data loss in case of system failures.
- **Type:**  Functional
- **Priority:**1
- **Rationale:** Data loss can be catastrophic for users and can lead to irrecoverable damages. Regular backups and restore functionality ensure data integrity and business continuity.
- **Testing:** The backup and restore processes will be thoroughly tested to verify that data can be successfully backed up, and data restoration can be done without any loss or corruption. Additionally, simulated failure scenarios will be executed to assess the reliability of these processes.


## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.
- # Current Constraints
- Time wise for this project is small typically with what students are usually provided. This is a full summer term class meaning that it covers the UNCC summer term 1 and summer term 2. While there is a good amount of time given to students there is not the same as compared to the fall and spring semesters. 
- Meeting our requirements. With the provided time there may be some small bugs or errors that may be unseen by our professional team. In these instances where proper testing has taken place and these issues still persist, our requirements for ourselves will have not been met. 
- Resource Limitations: The project must adhere to specific hardware and software resource limitations like we only have access to VS code and github to make this project. These limitations can impact the scalability and performance of the software system and require careful optimization and resource management.
- Team Size: The project team has a fixed number of members, and additional resources may not be available. This constraint can impact the scope and complexity of the project, as the team's capacity to handle tasks and deliverables is limited by the available manpower. Effective task allocation and collaboration are crucial to meet project deadlines successfully.


## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- # UC-1:
	- **Description**: When user information is entered through the interface the information provided will be sent towards a database that will update accordingly. 
	- **Actors**: What we see here in this case are the user, code, database. Here the user is the one providing the system with information such as their name, username, password, date of birth. The code will take this information and ensure that it is currently formatted within the database, meaning if date of birth is entered as a string the database may need the information to be entered as varchar. The database being the final actor will be actively updated with correct user information. The database will ensure that no two users are the same, correct data will only be processed (if the user enters incorrect information there will be exception errors to combat this). All three actors will ensure that the user information is stored correctly, easy to access for the correct personnel, and that retrieving data for users or software engineers is easy. 
	- **Preconditions**: In order to have data stored correctly the user must first be able to complete a verification process. In this case we are providing the user with a randomized six letter code in which the user will need to enter the exact number back into the system. The user must also be able to complete all necessary prompts to ensure there are no null entries within the system. 
	- **Postconditions**: Once data is stored the user can freely come back to the store without the need to create a new account. The account information of the user will be stored in order to maintain a professional and optimal experience.

- # UC-2: 
	- **Description**: Forgot my password entering identical passwords, to ensure the user is not entering the same password as their current password the system will check the database to see what the current password is. When a user forgets their password they have an option to reset said password. They will be prompted where they will type a new password consisting of varchar type in order to take string characters, int characters, and special characters. If they enter a password that is identical to their current one they will receive a message saying “cannot change password to current password”. This saves the user time as now they remember what their current password is as well as saving computational time. The system will use a .get() to trace back only the password within the database as all other user information in this case is irrelevant.
	- **Actors**: Here the actors in this example are the user, code, and database. Here the user enters their password in order to create a new password. Before the process can continue a check will be made to ensure that the user is not using their current password. Here the code we have created will pull the password that the user currently has. The database will be used as a source of information, here since the user is already logged into their account all the code will have to do is pull the password from the database. Once the password is pulled the coded will compare the user input to what is within the system. If the same password is entered an output will be given to the user and the prompt box will be cleared. The message will read “cannot change password to current password”.
	- **Preconditions**: The user is either logged into their account or is able to enter information crucial to their account such as their email or username. 
	- **Postconditions**: If passwords are different the database will be updated with the new user password. If the password is the same the software will not go forward with updating their information instead the password will be erased from the prompt and inform the user that they tried to enter their current password. 

- # UC-3: 
	- **Description**: User Login. The system allows registered users to log in using their username and password. Upon successful login, the user gains access to their personalized dashboard and can start using the system's features and functionalities.
	- **Actors**: Registered users and the system.
	- **Preconditions**: The user must have a registered account with a valid username and password. The user must navigate to the login page of the system.
	- **Postconditions**: Once logged in, the system recognizes the user's identity and grants access to their account-specific data and features until they log out or the session expires.

- # UC-4: 
	- **Description**: Adding Items to Cart. As a user browses through the system's product catalog, they can add items to their shopping cart for future purchase. The system maintains a list of selected items and their quantities in the user's shopping cart until they complete the purchase.
	- **Actors**: Regular users (shoppers) and the system.
	- **Preconditions**: The user must be logged into their account. The product catalog must be accessible and contain items available for purchase.
	- **Postconditions**: The selected items are added to the user's shopping cart, and the system updates the cart's contents. The user can continue shopping, remove items from the cart, or proceed to the checkout process when ready to make the purchase.

## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- # US-1:
	- **Type of user**: Customer
	- **Description**: Customer wishes to login but forgets their passcode. They wish to change the passcode and use a familiar passcode. The system says the password is already in use. Customer learns their password is their current password and the system does not need to make any unnecessary changes.

- # US-2:
	- **Type of user**: Admin
	- **Description**: Admin wants to check a user's purchase history as requested by higher authority. Admin is able to go back into the database and review a customer's history. The admin is expected to be able to have permission to see the purchase history as well as the customer's information. 
- # US-3:
	- **Type of user**: New User
	- **Description**: As a new user, I want to create an account on the system to access its features. I provide my email address and choose a secure password during the registration process. After registration, I receive a verification email to confirm my account before gaining full access to the system.


- # US-4:
	- **Type of user**: Regular User
	- **Description**: As a regular user, I want to search for specific products in the system's catalog. I enter keywords related to the products I'm looking for into the search bar. The system then displays a list of relevant products, allowing me to browse and find what I need efficiently. I can also use filters to narrow down the search results based on categories, price range, and other criteria.



## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

- # Term 1: Exception 
	- **Definition**: An exception is when an error in code appears. These exceptions can range in areas such as the system wanting to take a string variable, letters a-z, but instead a number or special character was entered, to more advanced issues such as code being referenced but not existing due to bad directory location or a slight spelling mistake in said directory. Essentially an exception is where there is an error in code. 
  - # Term 2: Multilingual Support
	- **Definition**: Multilingual support refers to the capability of the software system to provide content and user interfaces in multiple languages. This allows users from different linguistic backgrounds to interact with the system in their preferred language, enhancing accessibility and usability.


Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.
